# Learning-log

Learning-log is a multiuser web application written in `Django 3` and `Bootstrap 3` that allows users to track their learning activity.

Create some records to make your own Learning Log, and list the topics you're learning about.
Whenever you learn something new about a topic, make an entry summarizing what you've learned.

The project is deployed on heroku and available [here](https://learning-log-personal.herokuapp.com)
